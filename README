A tool to convert DICOM-video-files exported from ALOKA ultrasound to mjpeg AVIs.
Depends on libjpeg (I've included the source code in the jpeg-9 -folder).

The libjpeg needs to be compiled first with the typical commands (e.g. in the jpeg-9 folder):
./configure
make
make install

The converter can be compiled subsequently:
g++ -o save_dicom_mjpeg.exe save_dicom_mjpeg.cpp -static -O3 -march=i686 -ljpeg

The converter is run by calling
save_dicom_mjpeg sourceDicomFile outpuFile.avi
